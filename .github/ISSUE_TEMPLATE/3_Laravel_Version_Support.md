<!-- Here's how to support a new Laravel version. Thanks for your help! 👍 -->

### Follow these steps:

> Please, note that we have to update versions for everything, not only `illuminate` packages.

1. Update versions in `composer.json` according to Laravel's `composer.json`.
2. Add the newly supported version to `README.md`.
3. Open PR to the `master` branch.
